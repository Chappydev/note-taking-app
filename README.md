# note-taking-app
Note-taking application that builds on the knowledge gained from the todo-list app.

You can create a note in the initial form, and the note will be added to the grid underneath.

Click/tap on any note in the grid to bring it up in a modal, where you can view the full contents and edit the contents.
Close the modal by clicking outside of the modal, clicking the "X", or by pressing "Escape" on you keyboard.

Notes can be deleted from the grid view by clicking the three dots and then the delete button.

This project taught me a lot about utilizing external SVG images, and further challenged my ability to utilize JavaScript to solve problems.

I also pushed myself to make the app responsive for mobile and tablet users.

Application may not work best in all environments. I am using Google Chrome in Linux (Xubuntu).
